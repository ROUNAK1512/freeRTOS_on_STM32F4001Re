The project is a simple FREE RTOS demonstration on STM32F401RE nucleo development board. It toggles two LEDs one after the other.The project uses as less abstraction as possible(no HAL).
In addition a switch based toggling function is also present. 
Plan is to add more FreeRTOS features with minimal hardware.
The course uses contents and know how shared by PyjamaBrah team in thier FreeRTOS course

PS:Code is not structured well right now. I am planning to use AI tools to make the code more structured.
